### ðŸ§  Game Logic

* The game uses a **3x3 grid** represented by 9 boxes.
* Players take turns placing either **"O"** or **"X"** in an empty box.
* The game tracks turns using a boolean flag `turn0` to alternate between "O" and "X".
* After every move, the game checks for a winning combination using predefined **winning patterns** (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
* If a player wins, further input is disabled using the `disableboxes()` function.
* Game outcome is logged in the console (can be extended to display visually).

### ðŸ”§ Core JavaScript Features Used

* `querySelectorAll()` to select all grid boxes
* `forEach()` loop to add click event listeners to each box
* Conditional logic to alternate turns
* Array iteration to check winning patterns
* DOM manipulation to update text and disable boxes
